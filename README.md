👋 Hi, I’m Deepak Adhikari

I’m a backend-focused developer with hands-on experience in building real-world projects.
I’m currently learning Django and strengthening my backend development skills, while improving how systems work behind the scenes.

I enjoy building practical projects, working with APIs, and learning how scalable backend systems are designed.
